## Motivation

I wanted to create a repository for all the random small projects I create of the years. This repository may also give you the inspiration to try a new small project.

Wish you good coding! :partying_face:

## Description

Depending on the project you select I will try to add a new README-File so you can see what's the purpose/idea behind it.

## Additional notes regarding this project

This repository is always a WIP, so you can expect new additions after some time (probably not very regularly)

- Shellscripts:

  I'm using Git Bash on Windows 10 for testing. Just move into the folder containing the .sh-file and enter ```bash main.sh```.
  
    Example:

      *...\Small Projects\>* cd Shellscript
      *...\Small Projects\Shellscript>* bash main.sh
      *Enter your option:* **help**
