## Motivation

I wanted to create a repository for all the random small projects I create of the years. This repository may also give you the inspiration to try something new yourself.

Wish you good coding! :partying_face:

## Description

Depending on the project you select I will try to add a new README-File so you can see what's the purpose/idea behind it.

## Additional notes regarding this project

This repository is always a WIP, so you can expect new additions after some time (probably not very regularly)

- __Shellscripts:__

  I'm using Git Bash on Windows 10 for testing. Just move into the folder containing the .sh-file and enter ```bash main.sh```.
  
    Example:

      ...\Small Projects> cd Shellscript
      ...\Small Projects\Shellscript> bash main.sh
      Enter your option: help

- __PHPUnit:__

  You can run the test with `vendor/bin/phpunit src/Tests/`, this command will run all tests written inside the `Tests` folder.

- __Lua:__

  To run *__.lua__* files, you will need to install Lua on your system, for example you can use WSL ``sudo apt install lua5.3``. Afterwards you can simply run all files by ``lua filename.lua``
