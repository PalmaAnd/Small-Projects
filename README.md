## Motivation
I wanted to create a repository for all the random small projects I create of the years. This repository may also give you the inspiration to try a new small project.

Wish you good coding! :partying_face:
## Description
Depending on the project you select I will try to add a new README-File so you can see what's the purpose/idea behind it.
## Additional notes
This repository is always a WIP, so you can expect new additions after some time (probably not very regularly)
